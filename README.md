ClickNBuild 🏗️
ClickNBuild is a web-based construction project bidding platform built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and Python. It connects clients who need construction work with builders who can bid on those projects.

Client reviews the work and processes the payment.

Both client and builder confirm completion and leave mutual reviews.

Marketplace: A material price marketplace displays up-to-date prices for common construction materials to help clients make informed decisions.
